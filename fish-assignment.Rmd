# Fisheries Collapse Analysis 
Chandler Sutherland and Kaila Souza 

## The Database

We will use data from the [RAM Legacy Stock Assessment Database](http://ramlegacy.marinebiodiversity.ca/ram-legacy-stock-assessment-database)

First, we load in the necessary libraries, using the 'readxl' package to load .xls files.  

```{r message = FALSE}
library("tidyverse")
library("readxl")
```

## Reading in the Tables

```{r}
## old link not working today:
#download.file("https://depts.washington.edu/ramlegac/wordpress/databaseVersions/RLSADB_v3.0_(assessment_data_only)_excel.zip", 

# backup copy for class:

if(file.exists('ramlegacy.zip')){
    download.file("https://github.com/espm-157/fish-template/releases/download/data/ramlegacy.zip", 
             "ramlegacy.zip")
    }
path <- unzip("ramlegacy.zip")  #unzip the .xls files
sheets <- readxl::excel_sheets(path) #use the readxl package to identify sheet names 
ram <- lapply(sheets, readxl::read_excel, path = path)  #read the data from all 3 sheets into a list
names(ram) <- sheets # give the list of datatables their assigned sheet names

## check your names
names(ram)
```

# Investigating the North-Atlantic Cod

First, we seek to replicate the following figure from the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment Project using the RAM data.

## Plotting Total Cod Catch in Canada

Here we calculate and plot the catch in metric tons (MT) of Atlantic Cod from Canada using the RAM data. 

```{r}
cod_tsn <- ram$taxonomy %>%
  filter(genus == 'Gadus', species == "morhua") %>%
  select(tsn) %>%
  left_join(ram$stock, by = 'tsn') %>%
  left_join(ram$area, by = 'areaid') %>%
  left_join(ram$timeseries, by = 'stockid') %>%
  left_join(ram$tsmetrics, by = c('tsid' = 'tsunique')) %>%
  filter(tscategory == 'CATCH or LANDINGS') %>%
  filter(country == 'Canada')
cod_tsn

cod_tsn %>% select(areaname, areacode, areaid, region, country) %>%
  distinct()

```


```{r}
cod_tsn %>%
  group_by(tsyear) %>%
  summarize(catch_tons = sum(tsvalue, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
ggplot(aes(tsyear, catch_tons)) + geom_line() + labs(title = 'Fish Landings by Year', x = 'Year', y= 'Catch in Metric Tons')

``` 

Compared to the graph presented by the RAM data scientists, our plot shows a similar trend in the exploitation and collapse of cod populations, but has different y units. We are unsure as to why.

## Stock Collapses

We seek to replicate the temporal trend in stock declines shown in [Worm et al 2006](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.1132294):

![](https://espm-157.carlboettiger.info/img/worm2006.jpg)

The Worm et al. plot includes years 1950 to 2005 and is plotting the trajectory of collapsed fish and invertebrate taxa as calculated by year and cumulative collapse, represented by diamonds and triangles respectively. Black represents all species, blue represents species-poor, and red represents species rich. The regression lines are calculated via best-fit models, and are corrected for temporal auto correlation.  

## Plotting Total Taxa Caught Worldwide 1950-2006

Here we create a new table, general_tsn, as a broader version of cod_tsn to plot the number of total taxa caught each year from 1950 to 2006, using geom_point(), group_by(), and tally(). 

```{r}
general_tsn <- ram$taxonomy %>%
  left_join(ram$stock, by = 'tsn') %>%
  left_join(ram$area, by = 'areaid') %>%
  left_join(ram$timeseries, by = 'stockid') %>%
  left_join(ram$tsmetrics, by = c('tsid' = 'tsunique')) %>%
  filter(tscategory == 'CATCH or LANDINGS') 

worm_imitation <- general_tsn %>% 
  filter(!is.na(tsvalue)) %>%
  select(stockid, tsyear) %>%
  filter(tsyear >= 1950, tsyear <= 2006) %>%
  group_by(tsyear) %>%
  tally()


ggplot(worm_imitation, aes(x = tsyear, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + labs(x = 'Year', y = 'Number of Total Taxa caught', 
                      title = 'Number of Total Taxa Caught vs Year')

```

## Removing Incomplete Datasets

Species can either have missing data (within a series) or a time range 
that just doesn't span the full interval. Here, we group by stockid instead of year, to build a character vector containing only those stockids that have data for the full range (1950-2006).

```{r}
#here we modify general_tsn to be more useful for this problem
fish_3 <- general_tsn %>%
  select(stockid, tsyear, tsvalue, tsshort)%>%
  filter(tsshort == 'TC') %>%
  select(stockid, year = tsyear, TC = tsvalue)
```

We filter by 'TC' instead of 'Catch or Landings' to avoid double counting data that was entered as catch and total catch, which includes landings/discards. 

```{r}

#By filtering only those stockids that had 57 distinct entries, we can create a table of just those that have the full range 
stock_id_grouping <- fish_3 %>% 
  select(year, stockid, TC) %>%
  filter(!is.na(TC)) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  filter(year >= 1950, year <= 2006) %>%
  group_by(stockid)%>%
  tally() %>%
  filter( n == 57) %>%
  select(stockid)

#pulling out the column stockid to print a vector
stock_id_full_range <- stock_id_grouping %>%
  pull(stockid)

stock_id_full_range

```

56 taxa have data for the full range. 

```{r}
length(stock_id_full_range)
```
## Examining Which Fisheries Have Collapsed

A fishery may be considered *collapsed* when total catch (TC) falls
below 10% of its peak. For the 88 stocks with complete data sets, we created a new tidy table including columns: `stockid`, `TC`, `year`, `collapsed`, and `cumulative`, where `collapsed` is a logical (True or False) for whether or not that fishery could be considered collapsed in that year, and `cumulative` is the count of total years the fishery has been collapsed at that point in time. 



```{r}
#Add columns collapse and cumulative
collapse_analysis <- fish_3 %>% 
  filter(year >= 1950, year <= 2006) %>%
  right_join(stock_id_grouping) %>%
  group_by(stockid) %>%
  mutate(collapse = (TC < 0.1 * cummax(TC))) %>%
  mutate(cumulative = cumsum(collapse))  

collapse_analysis

```

## Plotting Total Catch

Using `geom_area()` plot the TC per stockid across all years. 
```{r}
ggplot(collapse_analysis, aes(x = year, y = TC, fill = stockid)) + 
  geom_area() + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = 'Total Catch per Year from 1950 to 2006', y = 'Total Catch (MT)')
```

## Calculating Percent Collapsed

To replicate the original plot, we must calculate the percent of taxa 
collapsed over time.
Using the `summarise()` function, and only the core stocks that have data 
across the full interval, we build a new tidy table
that gives the fraction of all stocks that are collapsed in each year and 
include a cumulative column that gives the fraction of all years (between 1950 and each year)
that has experience at least one collapse. 


```{r}
percent_collapse_analysis <- collapse_analysis %>% 
  ungroup(stockid) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(percent_collapse = 100*sum(collapse)/length(stock_id_full_range), 
            cumulative = 100*sum(cumulative != 0)/57)

percent_collapse_analysis
```

## Plotting Proportion Collapsed Over Time 


```{r}
ggplot(percent_collapse_analysis, aes(x = year)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = percent_collapse, color = 'green')) + 
  geom_line(aes(y= cumulative, color = 'blue')) +
  scale_y_reverse() + 
  labs(y = 'Percent of Taxa Collapsed', x = 'Year', 
       title = 'Percent of Taxa Collapsed vs Time') + 
  scale_color_discrete(name = 'Legend', 
                       breaks = c('blue', 'green'), 
                       labels = c('Percent Collapsed Each Year', 'Cumulative Collapsed'))

```

This graph is showing us the percent of collapsed taxa, with collapse defined as less than 10% of the Total Catch. Using this metric is problematic because total catch is not equivalent to true population numbers of fish in the ocean. Fishing technology vastly improved in the 1970s, as you can see in our first graph, and so total catch might have been low in the 1950s and 1960s while the population of fish was healthy. Using the cummax function we avoid any false collapses. 

Even using cummax, there are still some years that show collapse using our analysis but aren't necessarily collapsed. For example, stockid ARFLOUNDPCOAST shows collapse in 1954, but this was most likely a bad year for fishing as the following years show rebounded catch.
