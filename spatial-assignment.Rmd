# Data Set 
This analysis is based on a recent paper in Nature Ecology and Evolution, [**Mapping the global potential for marine aquaculture**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0257-9). The authors 
used multiple constraints including ship traffic, dissolved oxygen, bottom depth
and more, to limit and map areas suitable for aquaculture.

We are going to use a similar, but much more simplified approach in this analysis, beginning with mapping potential areas of marine aquaculture for the super cute Pacific spiny lumpsucker (*Eumicrotremus orbis*)

![They have adhesive pelvic disks! How cute!](./images/lumpsucker.png)

To do this we are going to use the following spatial data:  

**1. Sea Surface Temperature** (raster data)  
**2. Net Primary Productivity** (raster data)  
**3. Marine Protected Areas**  (vector data)  

```{r libraries, include= FALSE}
# install.packages(c("mapview", "raster", "sf"))
library(mapview)      #interactive maps, raster + vector layers
library(raster)       #Main raster library
library(tidyverse)    #our old friend
library(sf)           #to work with simple features data

```  

## Mapping Marine Protected Areas

First, let's examine some background information on the lumpsucker. 

From [NOAA's species description](http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/speciesid/fish_page/fish68a.html):

> A lot of people who see Pacific spiny lumpsuckers for the first time describe them as a ping-pong ball with fins. They are tiny and very inefficient swimmers, found most often in kelp or eelgrass beds attached to a rock or a log no deeper than 500 feet. They are quite common, ranging from the waters off the Washington coast, up around the arc of the Aleutian Islands, to the Asian mainland and the northern islands of Japan, and in the Bering Sea. A giant Pacific spiny lumpsucker is five inches long, but most are closer to an inch. Scuba divers are their biggest fans because the little fellows will eat right out of their hands.

Key information for optimal growth:  

- Sea surface temperatures between **12 and 18 degrees Celsius**  
- Net Primary Productivity between **2.6 and 3 mgC/m2/day**

### Load and Visualize Marine Protected Areas data
We'll start with a data file of Marine Protected Areas monitored by the US
Federal government on the west coast: `mpas_westcoast.shp`.


```{r}
mpas_westcoast <- st_read('shapefiles')
mpas_westcoast
```

### Visualize These Protected Areas

```{r}
plot(mpas_westcoast["State"])
```


### Protected Marine Habitat by Agency/State
Here we breakdown the protected marine habitat by the agency or state in charge of it's maintenance, so later on we can determine who is charge of protected the adorable lumpsucker. 

```{r}
most_protective <- mpas_westcoast %>% 
  mutate(protected_area = st_area(mpas_westcoast)) %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(sum_area = sum(protected_area)) %>%
  arrange(desc(sum_area))
most_protective
```


## Sea Surface Temperature Data 
**Sea Surface Temperature**

Our raw data contains 5 files with the annual average sea surface temperature for our region, and we will combine them into one raster file with the sea surface temperature (sst) for the entire time period 2008-2012. 

### Reading in raster data
Here we create a single sst raster layer. 

```{r sst}
rasters <- list.files("rasters", pattern = "average", full.names = TRUE)
sst <- map(rasters, raster) 
sst

```

### Visualization & Exploration
```{r}
plot(sst[[1]])
plot(sst[[2]])
plot(sst[[3]])
plot(sst[[4]])
plot(sst[[5]])

```


```{r}
map(sst, hist)
map(sst, summary)
```
#### Highest Annual Sea Surface Temperature 
By observing the summary tables, we can conclude that 2012 had the highest annual sea surface temperature. 

```{r}
map(sst, summary)

```


### Stacking rasters

To get a single layer of average SST in degrees Celsius we need to first `stack` all layers.

![](images/singletomulti.png)

Here we produce a raster stack across the 5 years, and then visualize using plot. 

```{r}
sst_stack <- stack(sst)
sst_stack
plot(sst_stack)
```

### Convert to Celsius

To make this data more accessible for later calculations, we will convert this raster stack into one, and convert our data from Kelvin to Celsius using a custom R function to perform the conversion: 
 
$C = K - 273.15$


```{r}

conversion <- function (K) {
  mean(K, na.rm = TRUE) - 273.15
}

conversion
```

We now perform this operation on the raster stack. 

```{r}
sst_mean_C <- calc(sst_stack, conversion)
sst_mean_C
```

## Net Primary Production Data 

Since Lumpsuckers may be influenced by more than just sea surface temperature, 
we want to include **Net Primary Production (NPP)** in our analysis. 
So we need to read that in too and create a rasterstack of ur new `sst_avg` raster
and the NPP layer. 

#### NPP raster data   

Here we read in the NPP data, which is measured in (mgC/m2/day), and plot it to visualize.  

```{r}
annual_npp <- raster('rasters/annual_npp.tif')
plot(annual_npp)

```

### Reproject and combination 

Before we stack these two layers, we must convert them to the same projection/coordinate reference system. 

Let's investigate the coordinate reference systems we are dealing with. 
```{r}
st_crs(mpas_westcoast)
crs_npp <- crs(annual_npp)
crs(sst_mean_C)
```

`annual_npp` is equal to our `mpas_westcoast`, but our mean SST layer is different.

We will need to define what the new projection 
should be by setting a coordinate reference system.

Here, we project our average SST layer into npp's coordinate reference system and prove to yourself they are now equal.

```{r}
projected_sst_mean <- projectRaster(sst_mean_C, crs = crs(annual_npp))
identicalCRS(projected_sst_mean, annual_npp)

extent(projected_sst_mean)
extent(annual_npp)
res(projected_sst_mean)
res(annual_npp)
```

The error about non-missing arguments is because in order 
to have our two raster layers match in extent, our SST layer covers a lot of 
missing values on its edges which `raster` is encountering
in the projection. We can ignore this error for now.

Now we can stack the now 
matching rasters together using the `stack` function and plot them.

```{r}
stacked <- stack(annual_npp, projected_sst_mean)
plot(stacked)
```

#### Probable Lumpsucker Habitat 
Lumpsucker fish grow best in waters that are 
**between 12 and 18 degrees Celsius.** and with an NPP between **2.6 and 3 mgC/m2/day**, so we predict they will survive not too close to the shore, off of the Oregon and washington coast where both of these conditions are met.  


## Analysis   

Now that our data is prepared, we can move onto **analysis**. For this specific analysis, we need to use 
the SST and NPP data to find areas along the US West Coast that are suitable for 
growing lumpsucker fish. 

### Sample Points & Extract values from Rasters
Here we use `st_sample()` function to sample 1000 points from the mpas_westcoast polygons, creating a "simple features collection," representing spatial geometry without attribute data. We then will convert to an `sf` object to be able to extract and retrieve the attribute data of npp and sst for each point. 

```{r}
mpas_sample <- most_protective %>%
  st_sample(1000) %>%
  st_sf() %>%
  st_join(most_protective, join = st_intersects)
mpas_sample
```

#### R Question: Why does your new dataframe of points likely have fewer than 1000 points? 
See the `st_sample()` documentation and explain. 

### Extracting Raster Values
We now use our sampled points to extract information from the rasters 
on sea surface temperature and net primary productivity. Also, we project the new vector data into longitude and latitude coordinates for later analysis. 

```{r}
mpas_extracts <- raster::extract(stacked, mpas_sample) %>%
  as.data.frame()

mpas_combined <- mpas_sample %>%
  mutate(npp = mpas_extracts$annual_npp) %>%
  mutate(sst = mpas_extracts$layer) %>%
  st_transform(crs = '+proj=longlat')
```

### Where are the lumpsuckers?
For the following analyses, remember that Lumpsucker fish grow best in waters that are 
**between 12 and 18 degrees Celsius.** and with an NPP between **2.6 and 3 mgC/m2/day**

#### Percentage of our Sampled Points with Lumpsuckers 
```{r}
  lumpsucker <- mpas_combined %>%
    filter(sst >= 12, sst <= 18) %>%
    filter(npp >= 2.6, npp <= 3)
  
nrow(lumpsucker)/10

```

#### Minimum Latitude of Lumpsucker Distribution

When we plot just the geometry, we can see that the y minimum, which represents minimum latitude, is 31 degrees. 
```{r}
geo <- lumpsucker$geometry
geo
```

#### Plot lumpsucker points 
```{r}
lumpsucker %>%
  select(geometry, npp) %>%
  plot(main = "Net Primary Production in Waters Where Lumpsuckers are found", axes = TRUE)

```
