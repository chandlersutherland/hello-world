# hello-world
This is a collections of my various school projects! Mostly algal and ecological in nature, all lots of fun. 

The "climate" report is an investigation of various indicators of climate change and global warming, including ice core data and global temperature fluctuations. There also are reports on global fish population collapse under fish assignment, one on extinction rates and the 6th mass extinction, and a final project specific to chlamydomonas reinhardtii and some of my data collected with that project. There's even a cheeky spacial data project on the population distribution of a very cute little fish.
